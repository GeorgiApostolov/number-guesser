## 🎮 How the Game Works

Your goal is to guess a secret number within a limited number of attempts. After each guess, the game gives you a hint:  
**"Too low"** or **"Too high"**.

You can choose from 3 difficulty levels:

| Level  | Range | Attempts |
| ------ | ----- | -------- |
| Easy   | 1–10  | 20       |
| Medium | 1–50  | 15       |
| Hard   | 1–100 | 10       |
